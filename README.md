# OPEX
OverPowered Enumerable eXtensions - _It makes your collections OP AF!_

Adds the following methods (and more) to basic .NET collections :

-IsNullOrEmpty : So you never have to check both all the time!
-RemoveAll : Don't just want to remove the first item? We got you!
-IndexesOf : Ever wanted to get all indexes of an occurence inside your collection? We got you again!
-Sawp : Want to swap two indexes together? list.Swap(5, 1)! WE TOTALLY GOT YOU!
-Uniform & UniformBy : Similar to First() and Single() except that this one expects a collection or properties to all be equal so it doesn't matter which one you get.

OPEX even provides methods that add randomness to collections such as :

-Shuffle
-GetRandom
-GetRandomIndex
-GetManyRandoms

If you are already familiar with ToolBX.Collections then the extension methods will be natural to use for you. We like to throw a lot but we also provide "Try" overloads for the lazy devs out there.
